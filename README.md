# OOP_tic_tac_toe
This is an OOP approach to creating a tic tac toe game, which is playable from the console.    
I created this to help me better understand OOP and to put it into practise.     

The game allows for two players, if the number of turns is equal to the amount of board spaces and     
no winner has been found the game will result in a stalemate.    

This was a difficult, but really rewarding project! 
I hope you enjoy looking through my code.
